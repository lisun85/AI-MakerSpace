              "\"LLM agents can be useful in several ways, primarily in the context of coding and executing tasks on behalf of users. Here are the key points regarding their usefulness:\\n\\n1. **Ease of Development**: LLMs are surprisingly easy to build, requiring only a few hundred lines of code in Python, provided that the right training data is available. This accessibility makes it feasible for a broader range of developers and organizations to experiment with and create LLMs.\\n\\n2. **Code Generation**: One of the strongest applications of LLM agents is in writing code. The success of LLMs in this area is attributed to the simpler grammar rules of programming languages compared to natural languages, making them particularly effective at generating and debugging code.\\n\\n3. **On-device Usage**: Recent advancements allow LLMs to be run on personal devices, making them more accessible to individual users without needing expensive server infrastructure.\\n\\n4. **Iterative Improvement**: LLMs can generate code, run it to check for correctness, and then modify it based on error messages. This iterative process allows them to refine generated code effectively, demonstrating their practical utility in coding tasks.\\n\\n5. **Agent Functionality**: Although there's some skepticism and debate about their capabilities, there is excitement around AI agents that operate on behalf of users. While examples of these agents running in production are still limited, the potential exists for them to handle various tasks autonomously.\\n\\nOverall, LLM agents are particularly powerful in applications related to coding, enhancing productivity and allowing for more complex tasks to be automated.\""

              "\"LLM agents, or AI systems that act on users' behalf, are considered useful primarily in the realm of writing code. They are particularly effective at this task because the grammar rules of programming languages are simpler than those of human languages, making it a suitable area for their capabilities. However, there is skepticism about their overall utility due to issues like gullibility, where these systems may struggle to distinguish between truth and fiction. This raises concerns about how reliable they can be for tasks such as decision-making or providing accurate information. The potential applications of LLMs face criticism regarding their environmental impact, ethics, reliability, and implications for jobs, prompting a call for responsible usage and critical discussions around these technologies.\""

        "\n",
        "1. LLM Context Recall – Measures how well the retrieved context covers the ground-truth information needed to answer the question. The reranked system is likely to perform better because reranking prioritizes the most relevant retrieved documents, reducing noise in the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Faithfulness – Evaluates whether the generated response stays faithful to the retrieved context. The reranked system is expected to improve this metric as well since higher-quality context should lead to responses that better align with the source material.\n",

        "3. Factual Correctness – Checks if the response is factually correct based on external knowledge.This may improve slightly, but if the retriever already provided relevant documents in the original system, the improvement might not be drastic.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Response Relevancy – Measures how relevant the response is to the user query.A better selection of retrieved context should lead to more relevant responses, so the reranked system should show improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Context Entity Recall – Evaluates how well entities in the reference answer appear in the retrieved context. Since reranking is focused on semantic similarity, this metric should see moderate improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Noise Sensitivity – Measures how much noise in the context affects response quality.The reranked system should have lower noise sensitivity, meaning it is less affected by irrelevant information due to reranking filtering out less relevant documents.\n",

        "Expected Outcome\n",
